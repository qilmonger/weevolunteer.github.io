				  <p>LUANG PRABANG, Laos: Many millennial travellers yearn for unique cultural experiences when visiting countries with rich traditions and history, such as Laos. 
					<br><br>So what if we told you that Big Brother Mouse (BBM), a non-profit organisation, is the perfect place to satisfy that craving and fill two needs with one deed – to have interesting conversations and forge friendships with locals.
					<br><br>Tucked along Phayameungchan Road, BBM has become a popular destination for locals and tourists seeking to converse with one another in English.

					Many locals enjoy sharing stories about their family and their way of life. Visitors are encouraged to share theirs, allowing for an exchange of culture. 
					<br><br>From light-hearted topics, such as their favourite music, to controversial topics that turn into heated discussions, both parties will have every opportunity to exchange their perspectives. 
					<br><br>For seven days a week, BBM holds sessions for two hours every morning and evening, giving visitors the choice of joining the group either at the start or end of their day. 
					<br><br>BBM helps young Laotians receive a better education and gives them a platform to practice their conversational English, having over 400 titles published since its bookstore opened in 2006.
					<br><br>In fact, the number of locals coming to BBM has grown steadily over the past decade, with their eagerness to learn chief among many reasons why BBM has seen tremendous success in Luang Prabang.
					<br><br>BBM started after its founder, Mr Sasha Alyson, was cornered in the streets by students who wanted to practise English back in 2003.

					For Swiss couple Philippe Jeanloz, 66, and Isabelle Jeanloz, 63, BBM has given them a deeper insight into the Laotian way of life. 
 					<br><br>“It is a unique opportunity to talk about things you can’t discuss when you’re just a tourist. This experience gets you deeper into the Lao culture,” said Mr Jeanloz, who is backpacking across Southeast Asia with his wife.
					<br><br>Mr Ian Longford, a regular volunteer at BBM, agrees. 
					<br><br>“It is a great cultural exchange for everybody. I’d rather meet one local than visit ten cathedrals,” he said, adding that his first few interactions at BBM were with monks. 
					<br><br>Furthemore, many local students continue to keep in touch with their foreign friends who have returned home, especially with the help of mobile phones and social media. 
					<br><br>One such local is Gkue Xiong, 17, who said that he continues to communicate with an American volunteer he met at BBM in 2018. 
					<br><br>The volunteer continues to help Gkue with proofreading his essays, including those for his scholarship applications via email. 
					<br><br>With many success stories coming out of his centre, Mr Longford hopes that the cultural differences or language barrier will not deter tourists from giving this experience a try. 
 					<br><br>“Don’t come in thinking you have to be a teacher, don’t be put off because you’re shy. Just come in,” said Mr Longford.
					<br><br>“Do something outside of your comfort zone because you won’t be put on the spot here. Everyone is welcome here no matter what,” he said. <span style="color: #E3B953">&#8718;</span>
