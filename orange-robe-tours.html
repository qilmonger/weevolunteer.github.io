				  <p>LUANG PRABANG, Laos: Apart from a rustic hand-painted sign, one may not find the doors of Orange Robe Tours (ORT), a profit-for-purpose social enterprise, to be particularly eye-catching. 
					<br><br>But behind its doors, former monks and novices are hard at work, all while striving to lead a normal life after leaving the monastery.

				  <h5>Story behind Orange Robe Tours</h5>
				  <p>Established in 2017, ORT gives visitors an inside look into Buddhism, and is the brainchild of 26-year-old Luke Tavener. Two years prior, he was volunteering across Asia to teach English in the villages.  
					<br><br>“I recognised the lack of support provided to novices and monks as they left the temple to transition into layman life, and devised the concept of Orange Robe Tours,” said Mr Tavener.
					<br><br>For many of them, adjusting back into civilian life is no easy feat, especially after  years of adhering to a strict daily routine and having all their basic necessities, such as food and an education, provided for. 
					<br><br>In fact, some find life away from the temple too overwhelming that they seek refuge in their home villages, instead of pursuing further education or employment opportunities in the city. 
					<br><br>“My aim was to provide them with an opportunity to pass on their knowledge and gain a fair wage while continuing their education or pursue other opportunities in the city,” said Mr Tavener.

				  <h5>The ultimate guide for fellow novices</h5>
				  <p>One of two guides working at ORT is Mr Sounanh Oulaxay, 20, who left his temple after seven years as a novice monk to pursue a university degree, just before his ordainment as a fully-fledged monk.
					<br><br>While some may find life after leaving the temple too daunting an experience, Mr Oulaxay shows how one can remain deeply connected to his Buddhist roots while thriving independently.

				  </figure>
				  <p>Passing on his knowledge on Buddhism during tours meant more than just sharing its history. He wants to teach people how to appreciate and respect it. 
					<br><br>“It is not just normal work, it is religious work. You have to be (very) perfect,” he said. “You have to be very good. You have to know how to sit, how to stand and how to walk in the temple.”
				  </p>

				  </figure>
				  <p>When WeeVolunteer visited Wat Paphaimisaiyaram, Mr Oulaxay gave us a glimpse into a novice’s daily routine during the temple tour. He revealed that they typically get up at three in the morning, before they meditate, partake in the alms giving ceremony or study in the day. 
					<br><br>“It’s not easy but it’s not difficult either. Monks believe that we should always strive for balance,” said Mr Oulaxay.

				    <figcaption class="figure-caption">A monk's orange robes hangs from a window.</figcaption>
				  </figure>
				  <p>While he enjoys the new experiences such as meeting new people, the structure of a novice’s lifestyle made the transition to layman life difficult, especially during the initial months.
					<br><br>“People inside (the temple) always speak the truth, but the people outside are not always sincere,” he said.
				  </p>
				  <figure class="figure">

				    <figcaption class="figure-caption">A guided meditation session in the temple is provided as part of the tour experience.</figcaption>
				  </figure>
				  <p>Today, Mr Oulaxay continues to meditate and chant as part of his daily routine, as it provides him a break from the hustle and bustle of life. 
					<br><br>He also continues to learn new skills, just as he did as a novice. 
					<br><br>In fact, being a tour guide has allowed him to pick up new languages such as French and German along the way.

				    <figcaption class="figure-caption">Mr Sounanh Oulaxay hopes to share more about Buddhism with more tourists.</figcaption>
				  </figure>
				  <p>He hopes to start his own business one day, to share his knowledge and create something meaningful.
					<br><br>Although he initially planned to enrol in university after leaving the temple, he has yet to do so, citing personal reasons. 
					<br><br>“You can have your whole life planned out, but plans change and life doesn’t always go how you want it to,” he said. <span style="color: #E3B953">&#8718;</span>
