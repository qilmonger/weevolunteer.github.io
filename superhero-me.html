				  <p>Since 2016, I have been volunteering at Superhero Me, a ground-up inclusive arts movement that aims to unite children from different backgrounds through the arts. We’ve worked with children with special needs and children from less-privileged backgrounds, and facilitated social mixing between all kinds of children through event-based art and music sessions.
					<br><br>Given that Superhero Me is run on an event basis, there are periods where we are kept busy and times when things are not as hectic. But I’m always thankful that the team is understanding enough to allow my involvement to be flexible and based on how busy I am at school. It’s a safe and special place that always welcomes and challenges me when I am back.

					One of my earliest memories of Superhero Me is working with a sweet boy named Philemon, who has autism and is non-verbal. It was my first time using more than words to communicate with someone, and after our first session I remember Googling simple sign language to see if he could maybe understand me better that way. 
					<br><br>Even though I didn’t stop trying, it was challenging enough to create a superhero costume with Philemon because he had difficulty focusing or expressing what he wanted. It felt like he was drifting off into his own world, always.  
					<br><br>Then during one session, I placed a paintbrush in his hand for him to paint his cardboard armour, and what followed caught me unawares.
					<br><br>He started painting the most beautiful strokes, albeit at his own time. Although he was still in his own little world, to me, that was most I’ve seen him express himself. 
					<br><br>For once I stopped talking or coaxing him to connect the way I understood it and just sat with him in silence, watching him make art where he was the happiest. 
					<br><br>Every season of Superhero Me teaches me something different, but I think the most significant takeaway I had this year was to recognise slowness as a gift. 
					<br><br>In March, I took leave from an internship to help out with a three-day Superhero Me camp. For children with added needs, they can take two or three times the duration to complete a task, and that is often perceived as a flaw.
					<br><br>But during the camp, when I let go of the rush and took my time to work with the kids, I really found joy in rewiring my efficiency-obsessed brain.

					For first-time volunteers, you might be hesitant to take the first step because you’re afraid you might not know how to communicate or act around someone different from you. But I believe that if you’re willing to try your best and be patient in connecting with someone, they will be able to sense your effort and reciprocate in their own unique way.

					It’s a lot of trial and error, but those mini breakthroughs make it all worthwhile. So, don’t give up! Everyone interprets and acts upon inclusion differently, but maintaining an attitude of openness and acceptance towards whoever you meet can only be a step in the right direction. <span style="color: #E3B953">&#8718;</span>
