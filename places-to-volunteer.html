					In December 2019, our team visited Luang Prabang for our Overseas Community Involvement Project. During our two weeks in the city, we spoke to many locals and searched high and low for volunteering opportunities that may pique your interest.
					<br><br>So why not bring more meaning and fulfilment to your future trip to Luang Prabang by visiting these places and making a difference to the lives of locals?

					Laotian student Xai Vue wants to be the first English teacher in his rural village. But his journey to achieving his goals is a long and winding road – he has to leave his family behind in the village to pursue a higher education in the city. Xai Vue also says that juggling his studies and a part time job is equally difficult.
					<br><br>But despite his packed schedule, he still finds the time to learn English. Every morning, he heads to Big Brother Mouse, a place where locals practise their conversational skills with tourists.
					<br><br>Big Brother Mouse was started to spark interest in English literacy among Laotians and provide village children with books. Today, it has helped thousands of Laotians improve their English.

					Ms Anabella Coria Zavalaif travelled all the way from Mexico to Luang Prabang to work as a Director of External Relations  at the Lao Friends Hospital for Children, a place she describes as “a special hospital”.

					When monk Somkiet Siyargionsar Obee visited a rural village in Oudomxay, he learnt that many children did not go to school because their parents believed that education was unimportant.
					<br><br>When he returned, he started Keep Helping Each Other (KHEO), a non-profit project that aims to spread literacy amongst youth in the rural and poverty-stricken areas of Laos by delivering school supplies and other useful resources to the schools.
					<br><br>His passion project is one that he is very excited to share about. When WeeVo visited the Wat Siphoutthabath Temple to talk about KHEO, Monk Obee ran out of the temple to meet us, and was smiling from ear to ear throughout.

					  In a country where many English language centres offer lessons at exorbitant prices, Laos Educational Opportunities Trust (LEOT) school is doing quite the opposite. 
					  <br><br>They are closing the inequality gap by providing underprivileged students the opportunity to learn English and computer skills for free. The teacher shares that LEOT has become a place of comfort and familiarity for both teachers and students here. 
				  </p>
				  <strong>Volunteering Opportunities</strong>
					  <ul>
						<li>While volunteers are not offered teaching opportunities, if they are qualified teachers, they can be teaching assistants or mentors for the Lao teachers at LEOT. </li>
						  <ul>
							<li>To apply to be a Computer Studies volunteer, you’ll need IT skills (Word, Excel, Internet etc.) </li>
						  </ul>
						<li>Participate in conversation practices with the students</li>
						<li>Volunteers can contact the organisation via email to ask if they can teach the students their unique skills. </li>

					<strong>If you’re interested in volunteering at other similar organisations in Laos, do take note of the following pointers: </strong>
					<br><br>Firstly, check that the organisation is a legitimate charity. Most charities can be found on https://www.guidestar.org/, https://directoryofngos.org/, or https://www.workaway.info/. 
					<br><br>However, smaller charities such as Keep Helping Each Other (KHEO) may not be listed on such websites. Red flags and tell-tale signs of illegitimate organisations include having to pay a high fee to volunteer. 
					<br><br>Secondly, think about the ethical implications and sustainability of the project you are volunteering in. Are you making the beneficiaries more dependent on volunteers, or is there a better way to empower them?
					<br><br>Thirdly, it has been recommended that you volunteer through organisations such as Travel-to-teach and OpenMind Project. If you intend to volunteer on your own, it is advised not to mention that you are in Laos to volunteer, since most volunteers are in Laos on a tourist visa.
					<br><br>We hope the information we’ve provided can help you in making a difference. <span style="color: #E3B953">&#8718;</span>
